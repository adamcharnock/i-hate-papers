# I "Hate" Papers

**Create easily readable versions of papers via OpenAI**

I often need to read a paper to provide background on a related topic. 
In these cases the technical depth of a paper can be a major obstacle.
So I created I Hate Papers to create easily digestible versions of 
academic research.

Currently works with:

* An arXiv paper ID
* A local `.tex` file
* A local `.html` file (experimental)

# Installation

    pip install i-hate-papers

# Example use
    
    # First set your OpenAI API key
    ❱ export OPENAI_API_KEY=...
    
    # Summarise a arXiv paper ID
    ❱ i_hate_papers 2106.09685
    
    # Summarise a latex file
    ❱ i_hate_papers path/to/some-paper.tex
    
    # Summarise a html file
    ❱ i_hate_papers path/to/some-paper.html

# Example output

* [Example Markdown](https://github.com/adamcharnock/i-hate-papers/blob/main/examples/summary-2106.09685-d1-gpt-3.5-turbo.md)
* [Example HTML](https://adamcharnock.github.io/i-hate-papers/examples/summary-2106.09685-d1-gpt-3.5-turbo.html) (includes rendered math using MathJax)
